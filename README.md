## Outstanding issues


### expected behaviour #4:

when button "Remove" (from Wishlist) is clicked, the book to be removed from the savedBooks array on User model

no tests as yet


## need advice

### alternative route for book detail:
     path="/books/:book_id"  or  path="/books/:bookId" 
     require for savedBooks which miss _id

     + need to investigate "/books/:bookId" for rendering details from WishItem

### image storage
