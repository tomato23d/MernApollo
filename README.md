# MernApollo


## About

MernApollo website project has been undertaken to understand and showcase the value of joint libraries for Mongo database, Express server, React page writing and the Node.js open-source platform. The content database is managed through Apollo GraphQL.

JWT token functionality has been deployed for login authentication.


## Purpose
