no tests as yet

### test an array of authors


### update wishlist styling

### alternative route for book detail:
     path="/books/:book_id"  or  path="/books/:bookId" 
     require for savedBooks which miss _id

     + need to investigate "/books/:bookId" for rendering details from WishItem

### image storage
